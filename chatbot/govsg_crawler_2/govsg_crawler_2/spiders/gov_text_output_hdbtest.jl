Additionally, for the small number of HDB residents who currently do not have direct lift access to their flats, HDB will increase the Lift access Housing Grant (LHG) by almost threefold, to help seniors and residents with mobility challenges to purchase a new or resale HDB flat with direct lift access. Update on the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme 2 The Ministry of National Development (MND) and HDB have selected 17 projects for upgrading in the latest 16th batch of the NRP. The projects are located island-wide including in Bukit Panjang, Sembawang, and Sengkang. More information on the projects can be found in Annex A . In total, over $165 million will be allocated to these projects, which are expected to benefit more than 25,000 households. 3 Introduced in August 2007, NRP carries out improvements at the block and precinct levels for HDB blocks built up to 1995. With all eligible blocks built up to 1995 already selected for the NRP, the programme has been extended to include blocks built up to 1999. The 17 projects selected will be the first batch of NRP projects to benefit from this extension, and the 16th batch of NRP projects since NRP was first introduced. 4 The improvement items for each project are tailored based on residents’ feedback on the features they hope to see in their neighbourhoods. Examples of block-level improvements under the NRP include the provision of Residents’ Corners and seating areas in the common spaces within the block. Precinct-level improvements could include drop-off porches, covered linkways, fitness corners, playgrounds, and landscaping. The works are fully funded by the Government and implemented by the respective Town Councils that will engage their own design consultants and building contractors, as well as monitor the progress of the projects. 5 Since 2007, over $1.5 billion has been set aside to fund a total of 229 NRP projects across the past 15 batches . As of 31 March 2025, 131 projects benefitting about 187,000 households have been completed, while the remaining 98 projects benefitting over 103,000 households are at different stages of implementation (e.g. public engagement, tender, and construction). Additional funding support for senior-friendly amenities 6 In line with Age Well SG 1 , future NRP projects will now include more senior-friendly amenities, such as therapeutic gardens with wheelchair-friendly planter boxes, fitness trails connecting senior-centric amenities, and wayfinding features along routes frequently used by seniors. These enhancements will help seniors to stay active and independent, enabling them to age in place and live comfortably within their community. 7 To support the upgrading works for these senior-friendly amenities, HDB will increase the budget starting from the 16th batch of NRP projects, from $6,100 per flat currently to around $6,600 per flat. Creating More Senior-Friendly Neighbourhoods with Silver Upgrading Programme (SUP) 8 Residents living in older precincts that underwent upgrading in the past, and hence do not qualify for NRP, can still benefit from senior-friendly enhancements under SUP. Launched in August 2024, SUP targets older HDB precincts, offering senior-centric upgrades to help seniors age in place more comfortably. Precincts selected for SUP are prioritised based on a higher proportion of soon-to-be seniors (aged 55 years old and above) and seniors (aged 65 years old and above), compared to the national average. The programme is fully funded by the Government. 9 SUP was first rolled out in four precincts in Chong Boon within Ang Mo Kio town benefitting about 3,400 households in 2024. HDB worked with our design consultants and relevant partners to seek residents’ feedback through a Community Improvement Walk in August 2024, before reviewing the SUP design for the Chong Boon precincts. The final SUP design includes features that promote residents’ well-being, encourage more active lifestyles, and enhance accessibility around the estate. These include a therapeutic garden, 3-Generation fitness trail with exercise equipment suitable for seniors, new barrier-free access ramps, rest stops with seating along linkways, and wayfinding features such as signages with pictograms at the community deck. 10 The SUP works for the Chong Boon precincts are slated to commence in the second quarter of 2025 and are expected to complete in the second half of 2026. More information on the enhancements can be found in Annex B . 11 HDB will now roll out SUP progressively to another 12 precincts in Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, and Toa Payoh (refer to Annex C for details of their locations), benefitting about 11,000 households. These upgrading works will be progressively completed from 2H 2027. Details on the specific SUP works in these precincts and implementation timelines will be shared with residents when ready. More Support for Residents Requiring Direct Lift Access 12 Since the mid-1990s, all new HDB blocks have been built with lifts serving every floor. Prior to that, most HDB blocks were designed with lifts that stopped only on certain floors, due to the need to build cost-efficient homes quickly to house Singapore’s growing population then. In 2001, HDB introduced the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) to retrofit older blocks with lifts that stopped at every floor, to improve accessibility and mobility for residents. 13 Since then, HDB has implemented the LUP in more than 5,000 blocks that were originally without full lift access. Today, around 99% of all HDB blocks have direct lift access on every floor. For the remaining blocks, HDB continues to explore possible ways to enhance the accessibility of these blocks. Nonetheless, we recognise that some households residing in these blocks may have more urgent need for direct lift access due to their family members’ medical or mobility conditions. 14 For such households, HDB introduced the LHG in 2020 to help them purchase a new or resale HDB flat with direct lift access. Currently, the LHG is set at up to $30,000 for families and up to $15,000 for singles. From 6 April 2025, the LHG amount will be increased by almost threefold as follows, to provide more support for households: Household Type Current amount Revised amount Family Up to $30,000 Up to $80,000 Single Up to $15,000 Up to $40,000 15 Households can use the increased grant to offset the cost of buying another flat directly from HDB, or a resale flat with direct lift access from the open market, depending on their budget and needs. 1 Age Well SG is a national programme that supports seniors to age actively and independently in their homes and communities.", "last_updated": "Last Updated 06 April 2025", "size_kb": 107.3037109375}

To effect the change, they will need to apply for a change in flat ownership (not through a sale), where there is no monetary consideration. For changes in ownership involving monetary consideration, you can learn more about resale part-share . Types of ownership changes (not through a sale) There are 4 main types of ownership changes: Addition of co-owner: e.g. Parents include daughter as owner Removal of co-owner: e.g. Daughter removes herself as owner Replacement of co-owner: e.g. Father replaces daughter with son as owner Total change of owners: e.g. Father passes on, and the son takes over the flat How do I change the ownership of my flat? A change in flat ownership (not through a sale) is a conveyancing procedure, similar to that of purchasing an HDB flat. All current and proposed owners must be aware and give consent to the change in flat ownership. This legal process involves the preparation of financial and legal documents. The process typically takes about 4 months, after all applicants have provided their confirmation to proceed with the ownership change and submitted all required documents. A longer processing time may occur for complex cases, such as those which requires lawyer's clarification relating to Court Orders. Who can initiate a change in flat ownership? Current flat owners may apply to change their flat ownership to include immediate family members who meet all eligibility conditions . If there is more than 1 proposed owner, they would need to decide on the manner of holding the flat upon the ownership change, whether by joint-tenancy, or tenancy-in-common .  A maximum of 4 flat owners can be allowed for each flat. Eligibility Proposed owners will have to meet these eligibility conditions . Guide on ownership change (not through a sale) Before flat owners initiate an ownership change, there are a number of things to consider, such as eligibility and finances. You can refer to guide on change in flat ownership . Application procedure You can find out more on the application procedure to change the flat ownership, including the required supporting documents to be submitted. Conditions after a change in flat ownership The proposed owners and withdrawing owners have to take note of certain conditions after the ownership change has been completed. Additional information If the ownership changes arise from a divorce, owners should take note of certain conditions that apply. Recommended Change in Flat Ownership (Not Through a Sale) If you wish to change ownership of your flat without a sale (i.e. without monetary consideration), find out more about the types of ownership changes and the eligibility conditions.

If you are planning to rent out or rent an HDB flat/ bedroom, you can take reference from these standard tenancy agreement templates drafted with input from regulatory agencies, associations representing the real estate agency industry and consumers, and practitioners who are experienced in the residential rental transaction process. These templates are just a guide, and you are free to amend the template or negotiate the terms contained in the template with your property agent to suit your needs and/ or requirements. Rental and deposit payments It is common practice for rent to be paid monthly. The first payment should be made on the day the tenancy starts, while subsequent payments should be made on the same day of each month. The deposit amount is usually equal to a month’s rent for a 1-year tenancy contract and 2 months’ rent for a 2-year tenancy contract. This is payable upon signing the tenancy agreement, together with the first month’s rent. The tenant should not pay more than a month's rent. As proof of payment, the tenant should pay the rent and rental deposit by cheque. They should also move into the flat immediately after collecting the keys. Disputes between tenants and flat owners Any disagreements, such as the rental amount, payment or forfeiture of deposits, right to terminate tenancy, and rental periods, are private matters between the tenant and the flat owner. Flat owners and tenants should try to solve the dispute amicably and reach mutual agreement. You should advise your tenants to read and understand all the terms and conditions in the tenancy agreement carefully before signing it.", "last_updated": "Last Updated 18 January 2024", "size_kb": 102.201171875}

Need to move out of my current home Yes Yes No No Need to buy another flat Yes No No No Need to top up CPF Retirement Account Yes No No Yes Receive lump sum proceeds Yes (after CPF Top-up) No No Yes ( after CPF Top-up) Receive cash bonus Yes (up to $30,000 based on CPF Top-up) No No Yes (up to $30,000 based on CPF Top-up and flat type) Receive Monthly Income Yes (from CPF payout eligibility age through joining CPF LIFE) Yes Yes Yes (through joining CPF LIFE) What Do I Need to Take Note of? Conditions for flat ownership - for example, sale or renting out of short lease flats on the open market is not allowed Conditions for renting out of flat - for example, owners must ensure that their tenants do not further rent out or misuse the flat Conditions for renting out of bedroom(s) - for example, owners must continue to occupy the flat, and the total number of persons living in the flat must not exceed 6 Sale or renting out of flat on the open market is not allowed upon joining LBS *Flat owners may choose to take up more than one housing monetisation option, if eligible. For example in Mr A's case, he received an SHB of $30,000 when he bought a 3-room flat and top up his CPF Retirement Account. 5 years later, he decided to rent out the flat to receive monthly income on top of his CPF LIFE monthly payout and stay with his children for mutual care and support. Taking up the 2 housing monetisation options allowed him to supplement his retirement needs. Please note that flat owners may enjoy either the SHB or LBS bonus but not both. Find out how families in different situations decide on the monetisation option that best suits their needs through our videos in different languages and dialects. You may also refer to these brochures on housing monetisation options in different languages ( English / Chinese / Malay / Tamil ) and the LBS leaflet on a worked example in different languages ( English / Chinese / Malay / Tamil ).", "last_updated": "Last Updated 24 January 2025", "size_kb": 110.5810546875}

We build cycling paths in tandem with new roads, and partner other agencies to retrofit existing roads with cycling paths, where feasible. For example, we worked with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to construct the cycling path network under Remaking Our Heartland (ROH) for Jurong Lake. Infrastructure such as bicycle parking facilities within residential estates and commercial developments help support this form of green commuting. Dual Bicycle Rack System Having a secure place to park your bicycle is necessary. Our Dual Bicycle Rack enables 2 parked bicycles to be stacked safely and securely. It takes up only half the space of normal bicycle racks.. It also has a bicycle-locking bar, so residents can secure multiple points of the bicycle using a bicycle lock. 57 sets of these racks were piloted in our first eco-precinct, Treelodge@Punggol in 2012, and subsequently in Yuhua and Teck Ghee under the HDB Greenprint.

The system taps on existing ERP technology and deducts parking charges from the CashCard in your In-Vehicle Unit (IU) when your vehicle leaves the car park. Calculation of parking charges For car parks implemented with EPS, parking charges are still based on the current coupon parking charges, that is, 60 cents per half an hour for non-Central Area car parks, and $1.20 per half an hour for Central Area car parks. The only difference is that the charges are now calculated on a per-minute basis. For example, if your vehicle is parked for 20 minutes, the system will only deduct the parking charges for the 20 minutes parking duration. Parking in the day (7:00am to 10:30pm) is capped at $12 per day for non-Central Area car parks, and $20 per day for Central Area car parks. For EPS car parks that provide night parking facilities (10:30pm to 7:00am on the following day), the system will be able to cap the maximum charge to $5 if you stay within the same car park and parking charges incurred is more than $5 for parking after 10:30pm. For example, if you park from 12:00am till 6:00am, the parking charges will be capped at $5 instead of $7.20. Parking charges are capped at $12 (for non-Central Areas) and $20 (for Central Areas) for whole-day parking. Grace period All of our electronic car parks provide a 15-minute grace period.

To ensure that Singapore can remain a great place for current and future generations to live in, we are bringing sustainable living into existing HDB estates with the HDB Greenprint, part of our 'Roadmap to Better Living in HDB Towns'. The HDB Greenprint is a comprehensive and integrated framework of goals and strategies to guide greener HDB town development, and create sustainable homes. In the Greenprint framework, we extend the concept of green and sustainable lifestyles beyond Punggol, to build Green Neighbourhoods, Green Flats, and Green Communities. The HDB Greenprint was first piloted at Yuhua estate in Jurong, where 38 blocks of flats have been transformed into a 'Green Neighbourhood'. Launched in 2012, the pilot HDB Greenprint programme in Yuhua aimed to bring energy-efficient, water management, and waste management features into this estate. It has since been completed on 28 November 2015. On 4 July 2015, the HDB Greenprint was extended to 40 blocks of flat in Teck Ghee estate, where about 5,800 households in Teck Ghee can look forward to an improved living environment under the HDB Greenprint. Works for the various initiatives are currently being carried out in Teck Ghee progressively. The findings from these projects will be used to refine the HDB Greenprint model before it is rolled out to other HDB towns. Residents can look forward to sustainable and green initiatives such as solar panels, sensor-controlled LED lightings, pneumatic waste conveyance system, and enhanced pedestrian networks.

What are the types of foundation systems that can be considered for design? Most types of pile foundations (bored piles, steel H-piles, micropiles, jack-in steel pipe piles, jack-in steel H-piles, and precast reinforced concrete piles) are acceptable except for timber piles. All pile foundations have to be designed with a minimum safety factor of 2.5 times the nominal working load. For the design of footing, the bearing capacity of the soil must be based on borelog results. If no soil information is available, the bearing capacity of the soil must be limited to 50kN/m2 at 1.5m below ground level. 4. What are the requirements for designing slopes and earth-retaining structures? The QP must submit the slope stability and design calculations for proposed slopes greater than 2.5m in height. Slope-protection measures must be in place to stabilise any slopes that fail to satisfy the required factor of safety. A minimum factor of safety of 1.5 is required for slope stability. For the earth-retaining wall, the following factors of safety have to be considered: Condition Factor of Safety Overturning and sliding 2 Allowable bearing pressures 3 Overall stability or slip circle failure 1.5 In addition to the factor of safety stated, the following requirements must to be adopted: Take into account the full water table height at ground level when considering the water pressure acting on the wall Take into account the surcharge of minimum 10kN/m2 or other incidental loads, whichever is higher Consider a minimum unplanned excavation depth of 0.5m or 10% of the total height of earth retained, whichever is deeper Net pressure analysis method is not acceptable 5. What are the requirements for designing new column? The new column must be designed as a short column and founded for independent structures. Columns or walls that are next to driveways must be checked and designed for vehicular impact load. Tie beams must be provided for columns at the ground floor and roof. No opening can be made through the columns. 6. What are the requirements for designing a new strong room or mezzanine floor within the existing structure? The proposed structure must be independently supported. For cases where the soil information is not available, the QP must consider the safe bearing capacity to be limited to 50kPa with a minimum founding depth of 1.5m. 7. What are the requirements for designing a new cold/ chiller room? A minimum air gap of 150mm must be provided between the cold/ chiller room and existing structure. The existing floor slab needs to be topped up with approved insulation material. Construction of the cold/ chiller room is only allowed on the first storey. 8. What are the requirements for designing new steel structures and claddings? S275 steel sections must be used for general structural steel members. Drilling is not allowed if a steel hollow section is used. Only steel plates, angels, or cleats can be used and they must be welded to secure the cladding or metal roofing sheets. If roofing sheets or claddings are designed by a specialist, the QP must check and ensure that the design complies with current safety, stability, and durability requirements. The appropriate separator must be used at the contact between 2 different metals to prevent galvanic corrosion. 9. What are the requirements for designing new grease traps, inspection chambers and screen chambers? All grease traps, inspection chambers, and screen chambers must be subjected to a design-imposed load of 5kN/m2. They do not have to be subjected to a vehicular load. The total operating weight (with full content weight) must be considered in the design. 10. What are the requirements for erecting new walls within the existing structure? New walls can be erected as long as the maximum thickness of the brick or hollow blocks does not exceed: 100mm for the first storey 63mm for subsequent storeys 11. What are the requirements for installing a cantilever awning onto the existing structure? A lightweight awning can be mounted onto the existing structural member as long as it is not a cantilever beam. Awnings that span more than 2.4m and are supported directly by reinforced concrete columns or peripheral beams must be propped up. 12. What are the requirements for the proposed Outdoor Refreshment Area? Adjacent to buildings taller than 4 storeys For an Outdoor Refreshment Area adjacent to buildings taller than 4 storeys (high-rise), its structure must be supported on independent foundation. The roofing material has to be non-combustible and be composed of: Reinforced concrete with a minimum thickness of 125mm Sandwiched panels with a minimum thickness of 50mm or a precast ferrocement roof with a minimum thickness of 40mm If the composition of the proposed sandwiched panel deviates from the reference above or if other (non-combustible) roofing material is to be used, the structural professional engineer must conduct an impact load test with an accredited laboratory and submit the test report to us.

Ms Chiu contacted HDB about stain marks and peeling paint on the ceiling of her master bedroom toilet on Jan 13. HDB visited her flat on the same day to investigate. As there was no sign of water leakage, and the existing paint had delaminated over time, we advised her to maintain the ceiling by applying a fresh coat of paint, which she arranged for her own contractor to do. In end-January, Ms Chiu contacted HDB to report a leak in her ceiling. Our inspection on the same day found slight dampness in the ceiling near the sanitary pipe. HDB visited the upper-floor unit on Feb 7, and found that an existing air-conditioner discharge pipe was not fully extended to the gully, possibly resulting in the dampness in Ms Chiu's ceiling. At our advice, the upper-floor neighbour promptly extended the air-con discharge pipe to the nearest gully in his toilet. In end-February, Ms Chiu reported that the leak had recurred. After checking both flats, we established that the flooring of the upper-floor neighbour could have deteriorated over time and caused the dampness on the ceiling. In such cases, the responsibility for repairs is shared jointly between the upper- and lower-floor flat owners. To facilitate flat owners in carrying out the repairs, HDB provides assistance under the Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) scheme, where HDB co-pays the repair cost with the upper- and lower-floor flat owners. This was offered, and the repair date was fixed for June 3. Due to the disruptions and industrywide shortage of construction workers arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, the waiting time to carry out GRA repair works has increased from one to two months to about three to six months. As the situation stabilises, HDB is progressively resuming the pace of GRA repair works. Should earlier slots become available, we will update Ms Chiu and her upper-floor neighbour. We recognise that the delay may cause inconvenience to flat owners, and we seek their understanding and patience. We will continue to do our best to help residents, including prioritising any urgent or critical works to be done as quickly as possible. Michelle Ng Chwee Geok Director (Housing Maintenance) Housing & Development Board Letter to The Straits Times Waiting months for ceiling repair Date: 22 Apr 2022 From: Chiu Mung Hing Water was leaking from the ceiling of my master bedroom toilet. I informed HDB on Jan 13 about the leak and was told only repainting was needed. The repainting was done on Jan 26 and water started dripping again on Jan 28. Many phone calls, complaints and even talks with my MP followed. I was finally given a June 3 date for the repair. For now, dirty yellow water keeps dripping from the ceiling. Is it a norm for HDB to take half a year to do any repair?", "last_updated": "Last Updated 18 January 2024", "size_kb": 100.0625}

We agree with Mr Chua that home ownership must remain the cornerstone of our public housing policy. Home ownership is a key national priority that gives Singaporeans a stake in the country, and provides the foundation for us to raise our families and build strong communities. That is why public housing is heavily subsidised to ensure that it remains affordable and accessible. The prevailing eligibility criteria for new flats, which covers over 80% of Singaporeans,  ensure fair access to the finite supply of public housing for the vast majority. Additionally, we prioritise public housing for those who need them most, i.e. first-time applicants who have more urgent need for housing, and to ensure lower-income households are not crowded out of a basic need. Mr Chua made several suggestions, including on the pricing of new flats and the subsidies applied to ensure affordability. We wish to clarify that BTO flat prices are not pegged to resale market prices. Instead, we price BTO flats to ensure affordability based on actual household incomes. This is why the average price of a new 4-room BTO flat in a non-mature estate was $341,000 in 2019 and $342,000 in 2022 even as the HDB Resale Price Index rose by 28% in the same period. This is possible because we have been progressively increasing subsidies to keep flat prices stable and affordable in the current property up-cycle. In pricing BTO flats, we consider a range of different household incomes, both above and below the median household income level, using affordability benchmarks such as the Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR), to ensure that there is a wide range of affordable BTO flats for first-time homebuyers with different housing budgets and needs. As flat prices in different towns cannot be uniform, we first consider the recent transaction prices of comparable resale flats nearby, as they best reflect the locational attributes of the BTO project. A significant subsidy is then applied so that new flats are priced below market to ensure affordability. In addition, eligible first-time flat buyers can enjoy the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant of up to $80,000, which provides further support especially to lower- and middle-income families. Today, most first-time flat buyers purchasing a new flat use less than a quarter of their monthly income to pay for their loan instalments. This means that they can service their HDB loans fully using their CPF contributions, with little or no cash outlay. Mr Chua also suggested lengthening the minimum occupation period (MOP) to 20 years. We have also received similar views as part of our Forward Singapore engagements. The prevailing five-year MOP is in place to reinforce owner-occupation in public housing. During this period, a flat owner cannot own, buy, or invest in a private residential property, or rent out the whole HDB flat. If the owner is unable to fulfil the MOP, the flat has to be returned to HDB, and we will then put it up for sale as a balance flat. We recognise that the housing needs and aspirations of some Singapore citizens may evolve over time as their family circumstances change or their financial situation improves. Therefore, after meeting the MOP, an existing flat owner may sell his/ her current flat to purchase another flat that better meets their needs. We appreciate Mr Chua’s suggestions. We have also heard many views and proposals raised by participants at our recent Forward Singapore conversations. The diverse views from these conversations reflect the wide range of housing needs and aspirations of Singaporeans. The Government takes these views into consideration as we continue to review our housing policies to ensure that they remain relevant to the evolving needs of Singaporeans. Sia Tze Ming (Ms) Director (Policy and Property) Housing & Development Board Commentary to Lianhe Zaobao Should not allow market forces to affect daily living Date: 19 Dec 2022 From: 蔡永兴 修改组屋政策 回归居者有其屋本义 拜读《联合早报》12月9日社论“组屋定价须理清观 念”，对化解政府组屋定价争议而应理清组屋的公共政 策本质，深有同感。 剖析此次争议其实就纠结在几个论点上： 一、建屋局制定预购组屋售价时，是否与其建屋成 本挂钩？有没有从中获利？ 二、土地价格是否应该以市场价格，抑或历史购价 来计算？ 三、衡量“可负担水平”以致津贴的多寡流程，有 多透明和公平？ 作为公共机构和公共资源，建屋局有无从组屋售卖 获利和土地是否以市价计算，对国人而言，犹如建造地 铁系统等公共设施一样，这笔账本就不需要劳烦国人微 观细算，而是由政府宏观处理。 回溯历史，组屋政策的公共物品定位是从1989年开 始，逐渐转型朝往资产增值（asset enhancement）市场物 品模式改进。组屋政策就从此含有一定的市场考量，以 作为个人或家庭未来退休财务规划的主要资产。 任何政策都有其利弊两面。虽然资产增值模式（例 如选择性整体重建计划SERS、共管公寓EC、黄金地段组 屋模式PLH）等，对理财有方的国人会带来丰厚回报， 但是对只想要有一间可供安居乐业组屋的大部分国人， 却是无可奈何，战战兢兢负债当房奴购买带有投机性投 资的组屋。换句话说，大部分国人仍然希望组屋是一个 可预见和能负担得起的投资。 虽然政府的津贴政策用心良苦，原意是要给国人吃 定心丸，对有需要的国人给予“可负担水平”房屋津 贴。但是水涨船高，带给人们的担忧是，津贴跟不上屋 价，年轻人害怕房贷会越来越重。更何况津贴多寡就不 完全透明了，有些人可能觉得某地区的土地价格较高而 享有更高津贴（编者按：建屋局多次重申，新组屋定价 不与地价挂钩），竞相申请，希望幸运“中奖”。为了 尽早锁定价格和享有更高津贴，年轻人投机进场预购 组屋（BTO）。这种先买房后成家，争先恐后的怕输心 态，是否值得鼓励？ 政府强调会调整国家津贴以维持“可负担水平”， 让人民买得起组屋，但是繁重的长期房贷会使年轻人对 未来感到忧虑，毕竟没有人可以打包票保证房价会稳 定增长，也没有人可以确保只要肯努力就会有稳定的工 作。反之，由于99年屋契和种种经济危机而导致未来资 不抵债的可能性，却是真实无情的。 与其辩论土地成本和津贴等课题，对我而言，争议 归根究底是政府组屋在公共物品和市场物品（市场化的 个人资产）之间的拿捏度，以及“居者有其屋”的原本 定义。 要在公共和市场之间求取新平衡，我有一些颇有争 议性或不成熟的建议： 一、政府组屋返璞归真，恢复组屋本质，将最低居 住期限（MOP）延长到15至20年，以延缓和降低组屋的 市场投机性。毕竟房子本该买来住，而不是投资的。 二、确保所有国人的拥有组屋基本权益，去除所有 申请限制，例如薪金顶限。有如民生福利，不论贫富， 只要是本国人就该享有公共交通、医疗、教育和组屋等 国民福利。 三、与其纠结于计算成本和津贴，未来组屋房价将 是与实际指标挂钩（例如公积金利率），不再跟随周边 转售组屋市场价格波动，趋向稳定。 四、由于新规定，政府就可将未来组屋卖价调低， 以符合“居者有其屋”的原来目的。逐渐地，房地产市 场公屋和商品房的撇清关系将会减低民怨，加强国人的 归属感。 五、在MOP期间，如果由于家庭经济需求而必须脱 售，就只能回卖给建屋局。建屋局不能将回购组屋以市 场价格卖出，而是必须以原价加费用转卖给其他有意购 买者，以维持其公共组屋的本质。 六、厘清组屋的公共物品本质，住满MOP之后，屋 主就不再受约束，可以在公开市场以市价脱手，以达到 资产增值为退休财务规划的目标。换言之，延长MOP将 延缓组屋转型至市场屋，间接抑制投机性买卖和组屋价 的稳定。 七、由于近80%的国人住在组屋，因此过去以较短 MOP但是较高屋价购买的组屋，仍然依照五年MOP旧条 规市场化。政策改变不应该一刀切，加上这将会确保房 地产市场照常运行，直到新常态达到明显厘清的平衡 点。 八、组屋达到百分百市场化之后，国人就应该承担 盈亏自负，包括99年屋契对未来房价的影响。 九、至于私宅投资，撇清组屋和私宅的定位后，我 建议市场投资不需要有更多限制。 的确，组屋制度关系到培养归属感和社会共同价值 观、安居乐业的建国国策。政府用心良苦，最终都是为 了确保新加坡人能够继续享有获津贴的公共住房，实现 新加坡建国以来引以为傲的“居者有其屋”理念。但是 公共和市场物品的环环相扣，让原本的用意变得模糊。 或许是时候对组屋政策大刀阔斧作出修改了。 作者是旅游咨询顾问", "last_updated": "Last Updated 29 March 2023", "size_kb": 119.21875}

During this time, we will follow up on items in the flat that require rectification. It is important that you report the items within 1 month of key collection and before your renovation works begin. This will save the need to investigate whether the defects were inherent from HDB’s construction or caused by renovation works. We usually take less than 2 weeks to complete the repair. In a situation where your renovation cannot wait, HDB can rectify the defects during the renovation (if it does not hinder your renovation) or after. Some minor defects can also be rectified after you have moved in (if living condition will not be affected). Within the 1-year DLP You can submit a rectification request online or at the Building Service Centre located in your precinct. Submit rectification request online To report items that require rectification, you can submit a rectification request online. Submit rectification request to Building Service Centre We have also opened a temporary Building Service Centre (BSC) within walking distance from your home. You can report items that need rectification to the temporary BSC. The availability of the BSC can be found in your Welcome Kit.

Communicate with your neighbours politely, listen to them and be willing to compromise to maintain a harmonious living environment. How should I approach my neighbour about his/ her annoying behaviour? Before the conversation Identify the most appropriate time to approach your neighbour. Don’t confront your neighbour when you are angry as this may upset your neighbour. Work out what you want to say before you speak to your neighbour. During the conversation Don’t lose your temper as this would make things worse and harder to sort out. Keep calm and be polite while you attempt to talk things through. Ending the conversation Thank your neighbour for his/her time and leave on a friendly note. Wait a few days to see if the problem has been solved. A conflict happens when two or more parties have a disagreement. Conflicts, if left unresolved, could escalate and cause tension among family members, neighbours and friends. Instead of getting angry, let's FOCUS on resolving the conflict . Facing difficulties in engaging your neighbour? You can contact your grassroots leaders (GRLs) for help. You may get in touch with your GRLs through your nearest Community Club (CC). Locate your nearest CC and contact information . How can mediation help me? What is mediation? During mediation, a trained neutral third party will facilitate a conversation between you and your neighbour to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. The mediator will not provide the solutions or make a decision for the parties. The mediator controls the process so that parties can discuss the issues and arrive at their own solutions in a calm and objective manner. Where can I find mediation services? Formal mediation services are available at the Community Mediation Centre, which has a panel of trained volunteer mediators. You can find out more about CMC’s mediation services and register your case online or call the hotline at 1800-CALL-LAW (1800-2255-529). More than 70% of cases mediated at CMC reach a settlement. Approaching the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRTs) Have you attempted mediation first? You are strongly encouraged to have attempted mediation before filing your case. Mediation is important because solutions which have been reached by mutual agreement have a higher chance of being sustained. What cases qualify for hearing at the CDRTs? The CDRTs are meant to handle unreasonable interferences with the enjoyment or use of places of residence. The CDRTs are a measure of last resort for residents because other means of resolution (e.g. approaching your neighbour, informal mediation) may better preserve neighbour relations. How can I file my claim at the CDRTs? The CDRTs are housed at the State Courts located at 1 Havelock Square, Singapore 059724. You can find out more on how to file a claim at the CDRT and download the forms online at the State Courts website.

Other types of works that require you to engage an appropriately licensed person include: Water service and sanitary works Have to engage a Public Utilities Board (PUB) Licensed Plumber Gas service works Have to engage an Energy Market Authority (EMA) Licensed gas service worker Windows Building Construction Authority (BCA)'s approved window contractor listed with HDB Electrical Installation Electrical worker licensed by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) * From 1 April 2018, only PUB licensed plumber will be allowed to install, fix and maintain plumbing systems for water service and sanitary works. You can engage a handymen (without PUB licence) for simple plumbing works. For more information, please refer to PUB website . General renovation Find out about our general renovation guidelines, including applying for permits and engaging contractors listed in the Directory of Renovation Contractors. Some types of renovation, such as those outlined in the guidelines for building and sanitary work , require a permit from HDB. You should only commence your renovation after obtaining the permit for these works. If the renovations do not require a permit, you would still need to comply with the set guidelines for the work otherwise they will be considered as unauthorised work. HDB will require you to discontinue, correct, or remove such unauthorised work and reinstate your flat to its original condition. If the work is allowed to be retained, you will have to pay an administrative fee. You need to authorise your renovation contractor to submit an electronic renovation application on your behalf. Your contractor is required to attach a copy of the acknowledgement form duly signed by you during the submission of the renovation application. An SMS notification will be sent to you once we receive the submission. Login to My HDBPage under ‘My Flat > Purchased Flat > Renovation', to view your renovation permit once it has been granted. Scanning of layout plans, elevations, sections or details of the proposed work may need to be submitted, if your renovations involve the removal or repositioning of fittings, demolition or construction of walls. Use the Purchase of Residential Floor Plan e-Service to purchase floor plans for your flat. Alternatively, you can approach the ‘Sale of Architectural Plan’ counter, at the 3 rd storey atrium of HDB Hub (next to Payment Counter). Electrical work and air-conditioner installation Engage an EMA licenced electrical worker for all electrical work and a BCA trained air-conditioner installer for air-conditioners. Certain types of electrical work require a permit from us before they can be carried out, such as those outlined in the guidelines for electrical work . For those electrical works that do not require a permit, you would still need to comply with the stipulated guidelines/ conditions when carrying out the works. If the works are found carried out without complying to the guidelines, they will be treated as unauthorised works. If you are planning to install air-conditioner in your flat, you are advised to check the guidelines for air-conditioner installation works before proceeding with the installation works. Your Licenced Electrical Worker (LEW) can apply for the permit using the Electrical Loading of Your HDB Block e-Service. Do note that you can only proceed with your electrical works and/ or air-conditioner installation works after obtaining the necessary permit. Work that requires a Qualified Person (QP) Certain renovations require you to engage a Qualified Person (QP) to certify/ supervise the work in your flat. Refer to the Professional Engineers (PE) Board website for the list of QP. Replacement of safety barrier Some HDB flats have safety railings or safety barrier integrated with ¾ and full height windows. These barriers are installed for the safety of residents and are designed to withstand horizontal loading as prescribed in British Standard (BS) 6399: Part 1 - Loading for buildings. Flat owners are strictly not allowed to remove these barriers unless they are damaged. For damaged safety barrier integrated with ¾ and full height windows which requires replacement, flat owners may adopt BCA’s approved standardised window designs which can be obtained from BCA’s website . This is subjected to the following conditions: the replacement works must be carried out by Licensed Builders (LB) or Approved Window Contractors (AWCs) with trained window installers (TWIs) who have completed the course “Module on replacement and reinstatement of safety barriers integrated with windows” conducted by BCA; the replacement works must satisfy the objective and performance requirements set out in the Fifth Schedule relating to the safety of windows, safety from falling, use of glass at height and any other requirement in these Regulations; and the LB or TWI is to submit a certification of completion of work declaring that the replacement works have been carried out in accordance with the standardised designs, and to be submitted to the BCA’s Commissioner of Building Control within 14 days of work completion. The LB or AWC that flat owners engaged will assess the existing condition of the window before advising if the BCA’s standardised window designs can be adopted for the replacement. For safety barrier integrated with ¾ and full height windows where BCA’s approved standardised window designs cannot be adopted for the replacement, or damaged safety railing that requires a replacement, you will need to engage a PE (Civil) to design for the window or railing replacement and the following would have to be complied: A Qualified Person (QP) who is a Professional Engineer (PE) in civil or structural engineering must be engaged to: Design and/ or certify the lateral loading of the replacement works Submit structural calculations and drawings to BCA for regulatory plans approval through the Construction and Real Estate Network (CORENET) Upon approval of the plans, the flat owner(s), the QP supervising the works, and the Licensed Builder (LB) carrying out the replacement of the safety barrier works must jointly apply for a permit from BCA to commence structural works Your appointed AWC has to submit BCA’s ‘Permit to commence structural work’ along with the approved drawings to HDB to obtain a renovation permit before commencement of the replacement works. Demolition of non-load bearing reinforced concrete (RC) elements (E.g. stiffeners, lintols and hangers etc.) Engaging a QP to inspect and supervise the demolition works will help to ensure that no load bearing RC structural elements (e.g. columns, beams, slabs and walls) are damaged in demolition process. We will let you and your renovation contractor know about the need to engage a QP for demolition works once we receive your renovation application. Note: The list here of works requiring the engagement of a QP is not exhaustive You and your renovation contractor will be informed if your proposed renovation requires the engagement of a QP Enclosure of Interaction Balcony (E.g. Installation of windows, awnings) Some HDB flats come with interaction balcony. Flat owners who intend to enclose the interaction balcony with windows and/or awnings are required to note the following requirements: You are required to engage a Qualified Person (QP) or Professional Engineer (PE) for Civil or Structural works to submit a building plan to SCDF for approval. Do note that this is a requirement under SCDF's Fire Safety Regulations HDB will proceed to grant the renovation permit after SCDF's approval is obtained You can refer to SCDF's website for more information. The list of QP and PE is also avaliable in SCDF's website. Purchase of floor plan HDB will have to conduct an evaluation for certain types of renovations such as demolition of walls. Renovation contractors are to submit to HDB, the flat’s floor plan showing the proposed work, together with the electronic application for renovations. You can use the floor plan of your flat given to you in the Sales Brochure during the flat selection. Otherwise, you will have to buy a copy of the floor plan at $5 through: Purchase of Residential Floor Plan e-Service HDB Hub, Sale of Architectural Plan Counter (3rd storey atrium, next to the payment counter) A self-service kiosk at any HDB Branch Charges for debris removal services Your Town Council may provide this service.

Flat designs were basic and functional to optimise space, keep costs low and allow for ease of construction. Our goal was to house as many people as we could, within the shortest time possible. 1970s Toa Payoh Town Providing Facilities in New Towns With more people resettled to modern flats, we expanded our role with the planning of comprehensive towns. Commercial, industrial, recreational, educational and transport facilities were planned for and developed in addition to housing, to provide a Live-Work-Learn-Play environment. 1980s Bishan Town Planning Quality Living Environments As HDB ramped up the development of towns, a new town structural model was established to guide planning. The precinct concept, comprising 7 to 8 blocks with about 600-800 flats, was also established to provide a more conducive environment for community interaction. A wide variety of recreational facilities for residents such as playgrounds, fitness corners, multi-purpose courts were located at each precinct centre. 1990s Blocks at Tampines Street 45, Tampines Town Developing Places with Character HDB began to develop distinctive identities for our towns, with new building designs and unique street architecture that leveraged the area’s heritage or topography, to foster pride among residents. We also introduced upgrading programmes that gave older homes and towns a new lease of life. 2000s Pinnacle@Duxton Innovating For The Future HDB pushed boundaries to build homes that are innovative, modern, and green. The 50-storey Pinnacle@Duxton, with several sky gardens, was developed during this period and remains as HDB's tallest project. Treelodge@Punggol, our first eco-precinct and a living laboratory to test new ideas and sustainable technologies, was also launched. HDB also introduced new housing typologies and facilities such as 3Gen playgrounds and rooftop gardens. 2010s Plantation District, Tengah Creating Sustainable and Smart Homes HDB raised the bar and unveiled a new generation of public housing that are well-designed, sustainable, and community-centric. We also announced plans for our newest town Tengah, which will be Singapore’s first smart town, planned with smart technologies from the onset.", "last_updated": "Last Updated 04 December 2024", "size_kb": 114.7021484375}

History of Tampines Tampines was named after the ‘Tempinis’ tree which grew abundantly in the area. In its early days, farmers and villagers in scattered squatter settlements dotted its otherwise barren landscape. A visitor to Tampines in the 1970s would have been greeted by undulating hillocks and deep craters formed as a result of sand quarrying. At its peak, there were more than 26 sand quarries in the area. The high plains in the vicinity were cut away to further level the area, resulting in 45 million m 3 of sand that was later used as fill material for the East Coast Reclamation project. Evolving Through The Years In the early stages of the town’s development, HDB took over 10 years to resettle around 3,720 villagers to make way for the infrastructure works. HDB began to develop Tampines Town in the early 1980s. The planning of Tampines Town was based on the Neighbourhood and Precinct Planning Concept.  The first housing precinct was built at Tampines Neighbouhood 2 to mark a milestone in the evolution of HDB’s residential development typology in the early years of HDB history.  The Town Centre was planned as an hourglass shape to create a unique urban design form for the town. In October 1992, Tampines Town was awarded the World Habitat Award in the Developed Country Category by the Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF) of the United Nations. The award recognises innovative and successful human settlements. Tampines Town has been designated as a regional centre since the early 1990s. Today, Tampines Town has one of the most developed regional centres, serving the Eastern part of Singapore. In September 2013, HDB launched the ‘Future Homes, Better Lives’ exhibition for 3 new development areas at Bidadari, Tampines North and Punggol Matilda. Tampines North is envisioned as a new ‘green shoot’ and extension of Tampines Town, akin to the growth of the leaf with budding new shoots. Guided by its vision, ‘Tampines in Bloom: Budding Communities within a Green Tapestry’, Tampines North will capitalise on its existing greenery and proximity to Tampines Regional Centre to create an attractive living environment for residents. HDB launched the first public housing parcel in November 2014 – Tampines GreenRidges with 1,900 flats in Tampines North. Depending on the housing demand, Tampines North is estimated to be developed further within the next 10 to 15 years. Notable Places Tampines Eco-green was opened in 2011. Showcasing different types of natural habitats such as freshwater wetlands and a secondary rainforest, the place is conveniently connected via the Tampines Biking Trail and Sun Plaza Park. The Our Tampines Hub was officially opened on 6 August 2017. It is Singapore’s first integrated community and lifestyle hub, housing a variety of sports facilities, a regional library, a hawker centre, a Public Service Centre, a Festive Arts Theatre, and many other facilities under one roof for the convenience and enjoyment of residents and visitors alike.", "last_updated": "Last Updated 03 June 2024", "size_kb": 117.4677734375}

As more Chinese immigrants settled in Punggol, they engaged in plantation work, poultry farming, and pig-rearing activities. Evolving Through the Years The Punggol of today is very different from its rural past. The blueprint for Punggol 21 was first unveiled in 1996 by the former Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, with the vision of developing Punggol 21 as ‘A Waterfront Town of the 21st Century’. In September 2007, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled new plans under the Remaking Our Heartland (ROH) programme. Punggol was selected as one of the pilot towns under the ROH programme, with new strategies and plans formulated to reinforce and realise the vision of Punggol as a waterfront town. One of the plans was to dam up Sungei Serangoon and Sungei Punggol, and introduce a man-made waterway through the town to connect these 2 reservoirs, opening up opportunities for waterfront living. In 2010, Punggol was selected for development as Singapore's first Eco-Town, to enhance the living environment in its estates and encourage residents to do their part for the environment. Punggol also serves as a ‘living laboratory’ for HDB to test new ideas and technologies in sustainable development, and integrate urban solutions to create a green living environment. One of the first eco-friendly housing projects in the town was Treelodge@Punggol. The vision for waterfront living was realised with the development of housing projects along Punggol Waterway such as Waterway Terraces I and II, and Waterway Ridges. In 2014, Punggol Northshore was announced as the first nature-centric district to test-bed smart technologies in public housing. These include an intelligent parking demand monitoring system, sensor-equipped lighting in common areas and smart waste management. Housing projects in the newest Punggol Point District, including Punggol Point Crown and Punggol Point Cove, were launched in 2019. Their designs pay tribute to the town’s rich heritage as a rustic fishing village. Notable Places The 4.2km-long Punggol Waterway is now one of the most recognisable landmarks in the town. Residents and visitors can take part in a range of leisure activities along the waterway and enjoy scenic views as they walk along the landscaped promenade. Recreational spaces such as Coney Island, Punggol Promenade, and The Punggol Settlement draw people living within and beyond Punggol.", "last_updated": "Last Updated 03 June 2024", "size_kb": 117.017578125}

Evolving Through The Years In the 1930s, several exclusively Malay districts were formed, such as the Kampung Melayu (Malay Village). The Geylang Serai Housing Redevelopment Scheme which began in 1963 and was conducted over 3 phases, transformed the area into a modern housing estate. By the 1980s, the old kampungs in the area were gone. Today, a bustling multi-cultural HDB population lives in the area, which continues to be known for its rich Malay heritage. Notable Places Tanjong Katong Complex, the first air-conditioned HDB shopping complex, was built in the Eastern part of Singapore. Within the neighbourhood, upgrading works to HDB’s Joo Chiat Complex have transformed it into a spanking new shopping hub.

In the 1970s and 1980s, kampungs in the area were relocated to make way for industrialisation and the development of Woodlands Town. Evolving Through The Years The town grew rapidly in the 1990s, and Woodlands was earmarked for extensive development to transform it into a regional centre for the northern part of Singapore in 1997. Today, Woodlands has grown to become a town with large open spaces, grasslands, parks, recreational facilities, and communal gardens. Residents can also look forward to the newly opened Kampung Admiralty – an integrated residential development with a range of healthcare, eldercare, childcare, and commercial facilities to serve residents of the area.

Although Singapore does not officially recognise October as Seniors' or Elderly Awareness Month, we are committed to active ageing and elderly well-being year-round. There are numerous events and initiatives that focus on engaging seniors, fostering inclusivity, and creating supportive environments. It's also a time to promote active ageing in communities! ► Check out: Programmes specially curated for seniors Benefits of Staying Active for Older Adults Regular physical activity offers a wide range of benefits for older adults, helping to improve strength, mobility, and overall well-being. Reducing the Risk of Falls & Maintaining Mobility As people age, they may experience muscle loss (sarcopenia), leading to poor balance and a higher risk of falls. Strength, balance, and endurance exercises can help improve walking ability and reduce the likelihood of falls. Maintaining Bone Health Older adults are more prone to osteoporosis, a condition where bones lose mass and become fragile. Resistance exercises can strengthen bones and muscles, helping seniors stay mobile and reducing the risk of fractures. Heart Health Regular exercise promotes heart health and can help prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVD). It reduces key risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. A stronger heart means more energy and less fatigue in daily life Getting Started: Recommended Exercises for Older Adults For those looking to get active, here are some simple exercises that target different areas of physical fitness. Before starting, remember these tips: 1. Consult your doctor if needed to ensure you are safe to begin exercising. 2. Start gradually and build up your stamina over time. 3. Move more, sit less—incorporate movement into your daily routine, such as standing during commercial breaks or doing light chores. 4. Include strength and balance exercises to reduce the risk of falls. Here are some suggested exercises to begin with: 1. Aerobic Exercises Activities like brisk walking, swimming, water aerobics, cycling, and dancing are excellent for improving overall fitness. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week. 2. Strength Training Strength exercises improve muscle mass and help maintain mobility. Try exercises like sit-to-stand and seated shoulder presses using light weights or water bottles. 3. Balance Training Simple exercises like single-leg balance or tandem walking (heel-to-toe) can improve stability and reduce the risk of falls. 4. Flexibility Training Stretching exercises, such as hamstring stretches or shoulder stretches, help improve flexibility and maintain range of motion.

{"url": "https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/140325", "title": "Correction regarding a false statement of fact in the Facebook post published by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam on 3 March 2025 | Factually", "content": "Home Corrections and Clarifications Correction regarding a false statement of fact in the Facebook post published by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam on 3 March 2025 Corrections and Clarifications Correction regarding a false statement of fact in the Facebook post published by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam on 3 March 2025 14 March 2025 Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam communicated a falsehood in a Facebook post published on 3 March 2025. Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam published a Facebook post on 3 March 2025, which falsely claims that the Government uses its monopoly control over the supply of land and control over demand of land through immigration policies to intentionally drive up land prices, including the prices of HDB flats, so as to increase the value of the reserves. Facts The Government’s land sales and immigration policies are not used to drive up land prices, including the prices of HDB flats. It is also untrue that the Government is intentionally driving up land prices and prices of HDB flats so as to increase the value of the reserves. These policies are also not used for reserves management purposes. First, the Government’s approach to land management is based on Singapore’s planning and development needs, and not to intentionally increase land prices and prices of HDB flats. Second, the Government’s immigration policies are intended to moderate the impact of ageing and low birth rates on our citizen population, and not to intentionally increase land prices and prices of HDB flats. Third, the Chief Valuer (“CV”) determines the fair market value of land based on established valuation principles, taking into consideration relevant resale transactions on the open market, and other relevant factors such as specific parameters of the site. The CV makes her assessment independently, without influence from the Government. Additional Clarifications The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority does not grant Singapore citizenship or Permanent residency on the basis of an individual’s wealth or net worth. Each Singapore citizenship and Permanent residency application is assessed on a broad range of factors, such as the applicant’s family ties to Singapore, economic contributions, qualifications, age, family profile and length of residency, to assess the applicant’s ability to contribute to Singapore and integrate into our society, as well as the applicant’s commitment to sinking roots. The Government provides housing subsidies to make public housing affordable. New BTO flats are priced for affordability. The Housing Development Board (“HDB”) assesses the market value of comparable resale flats, and applies a significant market discount to bring the prices of new BTO flats to affordable levels for a wide range of Singaporeans. HDB releases the selling prices of BTO flats and recently transacted prices of comparable nearby resale flats. The difference in price between BTO flats and comparable resale flats broadly reflects the housing subsidies. Housing subsidies have also helped to make housing affordable for Singaporeans. In 2024, more than eight in 10 first-timer families who collected keys to their BTO flats were able to service their monthly mortgage repayments using their CPF, with little to no cash outlay. State land is protected as part of the reserves. Paying fair market value (“FMV”) for State land preserves the value of the reserves. In turn, returns from investing the reserves directly benefit Singaporeans. When the State disposes of land, it does so at FMV to preserve the value of the reserves. This transaction is effectively a conversion of a physical asset to financial assets. Likewise, when HDB purchases public housing land from the State, HDB has to pay the State the FMV of the land. The proceeds paid by HDB accrue to past reserves, to preserve the value of the reserves. The reserves are invested for the benefit of all Singaporeans. Returns from investing the reserves supplement the annual Budget through the Net Investment Returns Contribution (“NIRC”) and help to fund public programmes that directly benefit Singaporeans. If the State were to receive less than FMV for disposals of land (including to HDB), the value of the reserves will be eroded over time. This would result in less NIRC, which contributes to approximately 20% of the annual Budget. POFMA is used to address falsehoods, not to suppress dissenting views. The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (“POFMA”) is not used to silence those who raise their views on the rent for 26 Ridout Road, or any issue for that matter. Members of the public are encouraged to read up about POFMA at https://www.pofmaoffice.gov.sg/resources/ . The Government issues a POFMA Correction Direction (“CD”) when a false statement of fact has been communicated, and if it is in the public interest to do so. It should be emphasised that a CD does not require the recipient to remove the original post. What it requires is for the government’s clarification to be carried alongside the original post. Readers can still read the post containing the falsehoods, and also see the government’s clarification, to come to their own conclusion. Indeed, nearly all of the posts for which Mr Jeyaretnam was issued a CD continue to be on his website and social media accounts, and remain available for the public to read. POFMA also provides for a mechanism to warn the public that a communicator has a history of putting up falsehoods. Mr Jeyaretnam has been issued 9 CDs since July 2023, and his website and social media pages have been declared as Declared Online Locations (“DOL”) from 12 December 2023 to 11 December 2025 (the “Declaration”). While the Declaration is in effect, Mr Jeyaretnam’s website, as well as his accounts on Facebook, Instagram, X and LinkedIn, are each required to carry a notice stating that multiple falsehoods had been communicated on these online locations. Finally, some may not just spread falsehoods, but also do so knowingly, causing harm to the public interest. A tougher stance has to be taken against people who intentionally harm Singapore’s interests. It is only if such persons are convicted in a court, following the due process of the law, that they may face penalties set out in POFMA. Thus, POFMA provides a range of tools to deal with falsehoods, and can only be used against falsehoods that harm the public interest. Mr Jeyaretnam has received multiple POFMA directions due to his attempts to spread falsehoods. Mr Jeyaretnam was invited to assist with investigations into his multiple falsehoods but he had informed the POFMA Office that he was overseas and unable to travel back to Singapore due to a medical condition. Mr Jeyaretnam remains abroad. On clarifications pertaining to the falsehoods that Mr Jeyaretnam has published previously, please refer to: http://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually180224 http://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually290524 http://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/factually040724 The Minister for Transport and Second Minister for Finance, Mr Chee Hong Tat, has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a POFMA Correction Direction to Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam. The Correction Direction requires the recipient to insert a notice against the original post, with a link to the Government’s clarification.

Since retiring from the national floorball team 10 years ago, 44-year-old Carmen Teo has focused her energy on contributing to the game in a different way – as a referee. Carmen's passion for officiating games goes beyond her love for the one sport; it reflects her passion for all sports. Finding community with floorball Sport has always been a major part of Carmen’s life. In primary school, she did track & field and badminton. In secondary school, she picked up taekwondo and began competing in it. She discovered floorball through the polytechnic Sports & Wellness module, where she played with her classmates. Y oung Carmen with the National Floorball Team Although she had many sports interests, Carmen was attracted the most to floorball’s culture of camaraderie, where everyone in the team trained together, ate together and worked towards a shared target – something missing in the other sports she took part in. In 2001, Carmen politely declined an invitation to join Singapore’s taekwondo national team for that year’s SEA Games to focus on training with the floorball national team for the 2001 World Championships in Riga, Latvia. She’s been committed to floorball ever since. Early days with the whistle Carmen’s interest in refereeing started when she was asked to officiate a match while still a goalkeeper for her local club. Following that experience, Carmen enrolled in a course offered by the International Floorball Federation (IFF) to improve her refereeing skills. Carmen refereeing a local floorball match early into her referee career. As she began her journey as a match official, one important thing Carmen learned was how to lead a game instead of policing it. She distinctly remembers one occasion early on when she responded to a challenge from a respected senior player by raising her hand to communicate, \"Talk to the hand\". “I definitely regretted this action thereafter and reflected on how to get better. Never again will you see me do such things,” says Carmen. From rivals to referee partners After a few years of refereeing, Carmen began the process of becoming an international referee. But before the Singapore Floorball Association (SFA) could nominate Carmen to the IFF, she had to select a permanent refereeing partner. In floorball, having two referees allows for better field coverage, improved decision-making, and quicker handling of the game's fast pace to maintain fair play and player safety. Carmen with Binbin during their early days as referee partners. Carmen selected Lin Binbin, whom she had officiated local matches on and off for about two years. Although they eventually became a refereeing pair, they had previously been goalkeepers for opposing local teams. “I was from Liitto FC and Binbin was from Titans FC, so we constantly competed against each other. We even competed for the national team goalkeeper position!” recalls Carmen. “We both have the same passion yet many differences that complement each other in various ways.” Carmen and Binbin at Singapore’s OCBC Arena for the 2023 Women's World Floorball Championships. It’s this dynamic that has made Carmen and Binbin such exceptional match partners over the last 11 years. Carmen is task-oriented and focused on game protocol and preparation, while Binbin excels in handling player confrontations when tough calls have to be made. Together, they cover all aspects needed to facilitate good game flow. Getting to the world stage In January 2013, Carmen and Binbin earned their stripes as IFF-appointed international referees. The duo’s first official international nomination was for the 2014 World University Floorball Championships at Singapore OCBC Area. Carmen refereeing a Women’s World Floorball Championships Qualification match. Since then, they have officiated at several major tournaments overseas, including the Women’s World Championships, Women’s U19 World Championships, and the Men’s and Women’s Southeast Asia Floorball Championships. Becoming an international referee has been a major achievement for Carmen. It has provided her with valuable opportunities to officiate higher-level matches with teams from Europe, where floorball originates. Carmen has learned a lot from various IFF referees she has worked with, notably Czech Men's pair Tomas Kostinek and Martin Reichelt. Since then, they have officiated at several major tournaments overseas, including the Women’s World Championships, Women’s U19 World Championships, and the Men’s and Women’s Southeast Asia Floorball Championships. Becoming an international referee has been a major achievement for Carmen.

Carmen has learned a lot from various IFF referees she has worked with, notably Czech Men's pair Tomas Kostinek and Martin Reichelt. Carmen and Binbin posing with fellow IFF referees. One of Carmen’s fondest memories from her international career was when the Norwegian coach thanked her and Binbin following a Women’s World Championships match. He asked which country they were from and even though his team had lost, praised them for a job well done. This gesture reminded Carmen of the impact a referee can have on a match. Pressing on for sports After 21 years as a referee, is retirement on the horizon for Carmen? Far from it. Carmen has already decided that her next milestone will be the SEA Games or the 2025 World Games in Chengdu if her physical abilities allow her to do so. If not, all’s not lost, for her passion for sports still burns. “Well, if I cannot withstand the physical aspects of floorball refereeing anymore, I may switch to another officiating career where the sport does not require physical elements,” says sportswoman Carmen. Carmen shaking the Slovakian Coach's hand before a match As for her aspirations for floorball, Carmen hopes that the sport will one day be included in the Asian Games or Olympics. She also hopes to help grow and retain the pool of referees for floorball locally. She wants retiring athletes to know that, with effort and commitment, they too can continue contributing to the sport in a meaningful way. Carmen and Binbin playing floorball with a local team during their downtime. “Being a referee can be a thankless job. There will always be someone unhappy with a call that you make. But #norefnogame. We’re here to ensure games remain safe and fair. I hope to see more athletes consider coaching or officiating after retirement, and for more local one to be nominated as international referees!” Copy this Page URL Related Articles Healthy Ageing: Simple Ways to Boost Brain Health in Elderly 2 mins Singapore's Chess Legacy Through the Ages 2 mins Sports and Shrines: Uncovering Singapore's Hidden Wartime Sport History 3 mins Related Topics Floorball Parents Seniors Olympics Youth Working adults Recent Events & Programmes J.P.

Moreover, badminton is a social sport, fostering camaraderie and teamwork among players, which can lead to lasting friendships and a supportive community. Unlike some high-impact sports, badminton is relatively low-risk for injury, making it an accessible option for adults of all fitness levels. Whether you're seeking a fun way to stay fit, eager to challenge yourself with a new skill, or simply looking for a recreational activity to enjoy with friends, badminton is a great sport to try and here's why: Simplified Rules Badminton has straightforward rules compared to many other sports, making it easier for beginners to understand and play. Minimal Equipment All you need to play badminton is a racket, shuttlecock, and a relatively small space, such as a court or even a backyard. The simplicity of the equipment makes it accessible to beginners. Low Physical Barrier While badminton can be physically demanding at higher levels of play, beginners can start at a slower pace, gradually building up their skills and fitness over time. Quick Learning Curve Basic badminton strokes, such as the serve, clear, drop shot, and smash, can be learned relatively quickly with proper instruction and practice. Beginners can start playing rallies and games early on, which can be motivating and fun. Flexible Playing Options Badminton can be played casually or competitively, indoors or outdoors, singles or doubles. This versatility allows beginners to tailor their experience to their preferences and comfort level.

This form of exercise is called calisthenics – a method that builds strength, flexibility, and endurance using only your body weight. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced athlete, anyone can start calisthenics at any age. It’s versatile, requires minimal equipment, and can be done anywhere. In addition to physical benefits, calisthenics promotes mental well-being, making it a holistic fitness practice. What is Calisthenics? Calisthenics originated from the Greek words “kallos” (beauty) and “sthenos” (strength), highlighting both the aesthetic and functional gains. Its roots trace back to ancient Greece, where warriors used bodyweight training to prepare for battle. Over time, it became a key part of military training worldwide. In Singapore, calisthenics has grown in popularity due to its accessibility. Outdoor fitness parks and community groups make it easy to get started without a gym membership. Unlike traditional weightlifting, calisthenics relies on minimal gear, making it both affordable and effective. Top 5 Benefits of Calisthenics Improves Functional Strength: Exercises like squats and lunges mimic daily movements, enhancing strength and reducing injury risk. Boosts Flexibility and Mobility: Regular practice improves range of motion and overall body control. Enhances Cardiovascular Health: High-intensity calisthenics workouts help improve heart health and lower blood pressure. Supports Weight Loss and Muscle Tone: Engaging multiple muscle groups at once, calisthenics efficiently burns calories and tones the body. Cost-Effective and Accessible: Calisthenics can be done with little or no equipment, making it available to everyone. Who Benefits from Calisthenics? Calisthenics is suitable for all ages and fitness levels. Whether you’re looking to improve general fitness, build strength after an injury, or enhance athletic performance, calisthenics can help. Beginners should start with simple exercises and gradually progress to more advanced moves. Basic Calisthenics Exercises and Equipment Start with foundational exercises: Push-Ups : Strengthen your chest, shoulders, and triceps. Pull-Ups : Target your back, biceps, and shoulders. Squats: Work the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Lunges: Engage the legs and core. Planks: Build core strength and stability.

Whether you are looking for a serene park setting, a scenic waterfront run, or simply a trail that challenges your stamina, you will find it here. In this article, we will dive into the three best running routes in Singapore to try! Fun Stats: Over 4 in 10 Singaporeans or 45% run at least once a week Most are in their 30s and 40s Over 25% of runners are part of a running community, group or club. Best 3 Running Routes in Singapore 1. East Coast Park East Coast Park is one of Singapore's most beloved outdoor spaces, providing a picturesque escape from the urban hustle. Length : 15km stretch Landmarks : Coastal views, BBQ pits for rent and a host of F&B outlets as well as water activities like sailing, cycling tracks, bicycles and even camping spots. Getting there : Nearest MRT: Marine Parade on the TEL, Bus, and car with multiple parking lots along the stretch of the park. What's special about it : The park's flat terrain, coupled with the sea views and the refreshing sea breeze, makes it a beachside runner's paradise. The route also offers amenities like restrooms, water coolers, and cafes to unwind or recharge after a run. Difficulty : Easy. The route's flat and even terrain makes it accessible for all fitness levels. Things to Note : There are several activity groups who organise weekly walks or runs. Find one which suits your pace and needs here . 2. MacRitchie Reservoir Built in 1896, MacRitchie Reservoir is Singapore’s oldest reservoir and still operational today. Its green forest surroundings surround the Singapore Central Catchment Nature Reserve, with running tracks and hiking trails carved throughout. The highlight is the TreeTop Walk , a 250m suspension bridge that offers panoramic views of the surrounding greenery. Length : 10 km long, with several paths and loops to choose from. Getting there : Nearest MRT: Marymount, Upper Thomson and Caldecott. Buses and by car, with marketing parking available at the reservoir. What's special about it: This trail offers a unique blend of forest and water views, and you might even spot some wildlife along the way. Think crocodiles, otters, and monkeys. Remember to read the park signs regarding wildlife but do not panic if you encounter one. Difficulty : Moderate to difficult. The trail includes some hilly and uneven sections, which provide a good workout for more experienced runners. The dense forest can be daunting and for beginners, start your route with company, in case you get lost. Fun Fact: From MacRitchie, one can follow the trail towards Bukit Timah Hill. There are several guides to do this. Check out here . 3. Southern Ridges The Southern Ridges offer a scenic 10km trail that connects several parks and green spaces in Singapore. Length : Approximately 10+ km. *If you connect to Hort Park and beyond, it can go up to well over 15km. Landmarks : Henderson Waves, Hortpark and stunning views of the southern waters. Getting there: Nearest MRT: Harbourfront MRT By car, with several entry points including Mount Faber and Kent Ridge Park. What's special about it : This trail offers a diverse running experience, with elevated paths, forest trails, and historical sites such as cannon lookouts from WWII. Difficulty : Moderate. The trail includes some steep inclines, workout stations and stairs to the tops of hills, making it a good challenge for runners looking to elevate their workout. Note: This route can be challenging due to the historical sites and how far it stretches along the southern region. It can be more “ulu” than a running route like East Coast, so come prepared. When choosing a running route in Singapore, consider your fitness level, the type of scenery you enjoy, and the kind of challenge you’re seeking. Beginners might prefer the flat, coastal paths of East Coast Park, while more experienced runners might enjoy the hilly trails of MacRitchie Reservoir or the diverse terrain of the Southern Ridges. Each route offers a unique and rewarding running experience in the heart of Singapore’s lush and vibrant landscape. Lace up your running shoes, hit the trails, and discover the best of Singapore's running routes!

Facts A.      SLA did not assure Minister Shanmugam of a further extension beyond the expiry of the tenancy term in 2027. 4.      Tenancies for residential State properties are granted for 2 or 3-year terms, with a maximum initial agreement of 3+3+3 years (i.e. renewal every 3 years up to a total of 9 years). 5.      SLA typically allows tenancy renewals upon the expiry of any tenancy term, subject to prevailing market conditions, unless: a.           the government has other plans for the site; or b.          the tenant has a poor track record (e.g. rent arrears or breaches of tenancy rules). 6.      26 Ridout Road is subject to a Tenancy Agreement of 3+3+3 years commencing in June 2018. The tenancy was renewed for a third 3-year term from June 2024 till June 2027 in line with SLA’s prevailing guidelines. 7.      There has not been any new undisclosed tenancy term, nor has SLA given any assurance to Minister Shanmugam of any extension beyond the expiry of the term in 2027.  The grant of a further renewal will depend on the factors raised in paragraph 5 above. 8.      Further, during the tenancy, SLA generally allows tenants to carry out improvement works on their property. SLA would advise its tenants to consider the remaining timeframe when planning improvements. The decision on whether and when to undertake such works rests with the tenants. B.      URA and BCA ensured that all their requisite approvals were obtained for the works carried out at 26 Ridout Road. When URA and/or BCA approval is applicable for works carried out on State properties tenanted by SLA 9.      For State properties tenanted out by SLA, URA’s approval is only required for works that: a.          affect conserved buildings or monuments; or b.          exceed 10% of the existing Gross Floor Area of the property. 10.      To streamline the planning application process for works carried out on these properties, URA and SLA have in place a set of pre-authorised works that do not require URA’s approval and only require SLA’s in-principle agreement. SLA’s in-principle agreement must be obtained on the proposed works before they can be carried out on the tenanted property. URA issued circulars in 2015 and 2017 to inform the industry about this streamlined process. 11.      Tenants must still obtain clearance from relevant technical agencies, such as BCA, where necessary. One category of works that does not require BCA’s approval is “ insignificant building works ” as prescribed under the First Schedule to the Building Control Regulations 2003 (“ BCR ”) read with Regulation 3A of the BCR. 12.      The onus is on the Qualified Person [1] (“ QP ”) engaged by the tenant or SLA to obtain the requisite approvals from relevant agencies prior to carrying out the proposed works. With respect to the works carried out at 26 Ridout Road, all requisite approvals were obtained 13.      For earthworks carried out within the property by the tenant since 2024 : a.      SLA’s in-principle agreement was obtained; b.      URA’s approval was not required as such works fell within the scope of pre-authorised works. Nonetheless, the QP engaged by the tenant had sought approval from URA, and URA advised that its approval was not required; and c.      BCA’s approval was obtained. 14.      For the swimming pool installed by the tenant in 2018: a.           URA’s approval was not required since the pool installation was external to and did not affect the conserved building. The fact that URA’s approval was not required had already been addressed in the June 2023 Report on the Review of the Rentals of State Properties at No. 26 and No. 31 Ridout Road (“ Review Report ”). b.           BCA’s approval was not required since the pool installation was considered “ insignificant building works ” under the First Schedule to the BCR . This was because the excavation and earth retaining structure works did not exceed a height of 1.5m. 15.      SLA, as landlord, had also carried out structural works, comprising: a.      repairs to timber floor beams and joists at the main building and timber beams at a linkway in 2018; b.      replacement of damaged timber members in 2024; and c.      restoration and replacement of existing doors and windows in 2024/2025 (collectively “ Structural Works ”). 16.      For the Structural Works at paragraph 15(a) and 15(b): a.      URA’s approval was obtained in 2024 and 2023 respectively, per conservation guidelines.  While URA’s approval was not obtained prior to commencing the Structural Works at paragraph 15(a), SLA’s appointed QP subsequently paid a civil penalty that was issued to SLA and obtained URA’s approval to retain the works in April 2024. b.      BCA’s approval was obtained in 2018 and 2024 respectively, as the works involved modifications to the structure of the building and were not considered “ insignificant building works ” under the First Schedule to the BCR. Further, as BCA's website displays approvals obtained in the current and preceding calendar year, the absence of older approvals online does not mean that such approvals were not issued. 17.      For the Structural Works at paragraph 15(c), URA’s approval was obtained in 2023 (and its validity subsequently extended in 2024), as the works affected the conserved building. BCA’s approval was not required, as the works were considered insignificant building works under the First Schedule to the BCR. 18.      SLA bore the costs of the Structural Works as part of its obligations as landlord, to ensure that the rented property is in good condition for safe occupancy and to protect the property’s heritage value, in line with the relevant conservation and restoration guidelines. SLA’s obligation in this regard had been addressed in the Review Report and during the Parliamentary sitting on 3 July 2023. C.      No public funds were used to pay for the earthworks at 26 Ridout Road carried out since 2024. 19.      The tenant at 26 Ridout Road bore the full costs of the earthworks conducted since 2024, as well as the other improvement works carried out by the tenant. No public funds were used to finance these works. Conclusion 20.      TOC had previously published false statements of fact regarding the rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road. Despite having received a Correction Direction on 18 February 2024 under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (“ POFMA ”) for various falsehoods in relation to these properties, TOC persists in making baseless assertions of impropriety by Ministers, SLA and other public agencies. 21.      Upholding a system of governance with high standards of integrity is an ongoing, collective effort. We urge the public to be discerning, especially of articles from TOC which have previously made unsubstantiated allegations and omitted publicly available facts. Such actions undermine our public institutions. 22.      The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Mr Edwin Tong, has instructed the POFMA Office to issue Correction Directions to TOC and “Twenty Two Thirty” in respect of their articles or posts. The Correction Directions require the recipients to insert a notice against the original article or post (or in a specified online location, where the article or post has been removed), with a link to the Government’s clarification. [1] A Qualified Person is a person who is registered as an Architect with the Board of Architects (BOA) or a Professional Engineer with the Professional Engineers Board (PEB) and has a valid practicing certificate issued by the BOA or PEB respectively.

Car parks with the coupon system Some HDB car parks use the coupon parking system. If you do not have a valid season parking, you must display a parking coupon or use the Parking.sg mobile application when you park at these car parks. Car parks with Electronic Parking System (EPS) Most HDB car parks use the EPS. Parking charges at these car parks are computed on a per-minute basis, and you do not have to display a parking coupon. For short-term parking, the system reads the In-vehicle Unit (IU) numbers of vehicles entering the car park. Your CashCard must be inserted in the IU for parking charges to be deducted when leaving the car park. For season parking holders, the system identifies the vehicles through their IU numbers, when entering and leaving the car park. Grace period Most EPS car parks give a 15-minute grace period. You will not be charged if you exit the car park within 15 minutes. Recommended Season Parking If you are a motorist looking for long-term parking in an HDB car park, you can apply for Season Parking. Find out more about season parking related matters here. Application Procedure Learn how you can apply for season parking and check for available parking options. Coupon Parking Find out where you can buy parking coupons, and how to display them. Transfer of Season Parking You can transfer your season parking if you have changed your vehicle or car park.", "last_updated": "Last Updated 06 January 2022", "size_kb": 115.2197265625}

{"url": "https://www.factually.gov.sg/corrections-and-clarifications/210325", "title": "Corrections regarding false statements concerning the employment of foreign auxiliary police officers | Factually", "content": "Home Corrections and Clarifications Corrections regarding false statements concerning the employment of foreign auxiliary police officers Corrections and Clarifications Corrections regarding false statements concerning the employment of foreign auxiliary police officers 21 March 2025 False statements concerning the employment of foreign auxiliary police officers The Ministry of Home Affairs (“ MHA ”) is aware of the following publications that contain false statements concerning the employment of foreign auxiliary police officers (“ APOs ”): Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam’s (“ Mr Jeyaretnam ”) article posted on his website, The Ricebowl Singapore, on 9 March 2025 (“ TRS article ”), Mr Jeyaretnam’s Facebook post of 9 March 2025, and Mr Jeyaretnam’s X post of 9 March 2025. The falsehoods contained in the said publications are: APOs have all the powers of regular police officers. Foreign APOs are employed by the Government and are used to keep the incumbent political party (i.e. the People’s Action Party) in power, even to the extent of violating the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and using force in breach of fundamental liberties. The Government deliberately sets the salaries of APOs at a level that would make the role of an APO less attractive to Singaporeans so as to achieve its real objective of hiring foreign APOs, which is its preference. Facts: Powers of APOs Under section 92(4) of the Police Force Act 2004, the powers of an APO are conferred by the Commissioner of Police. These are set out in Gazette Notification No. 170/2017, titled “Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Auxiliary Police Officers” (“ Notification ”). As stated in the Notification, APOs do not have all the powers of regular police officers. In particular, APOs do not have the powers of investigation that police officers have under Part IV of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, and the power of arrest of APOs is subject to conditions that are not applicable to police officers. The powers conferred on APOs may only be exercised by an APO when the APO is on official duty and in the course of performing the duties of an APO. Employment & regulation of APOs The Singapore Government does not employ APOs, whether local or foreign. Instead, all APOs are employed by Auxiliary Police Forces (“ APFs ”), which are not part of the Singapore Government. The list of APFs and their respective employers is published in Gazette Notification No. 398/2025, titled “Auxiliary Police Forces”. The security services that APFs are permitted to provide are carefully circumscribed by the Singapore Police Force. All APOs are legally obliged to comply with our laws, including the Constitution and those relating to fundamental liberties, in the discharge of their duties. These measures collectively prevent abuse of power by APFs and APOs, and ensure that they serve Singapore’s legitimate security needs. Salaries of APOs & proportion of foreign APOs The salaries of APOs are independently determined by their respective employers, the APFs, and not the Government. APOs do not belong to any union, fall under any tripartite alliance, or similar organisation, which the Government is part of, and which has an influence on the salaries of APOs. As at end-January 2025, Singaporeans continue to make up the majority of APOs employed. The proportion of APOs from the new foreign sources (i.e., China, India, Myanmar, Philippines, and Sri Lanka) remains very low, at around 3%. The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of falsehoods. The Minister for Digital Development and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (“ POFMA ”) Office to issue a POFMA Correction Direction (“ CD ”) to Mr Jeyaretnam in relation to his Facebook and X posts and TRS article. The CD requires Mr Jeyaretnam to insert Correction Notices relating to the original posts, with a link to the Government’s clarification. This is the 10 th Correction Direction that has been issued to Mr Jeyaretnam. We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unverified rumours.

Pickleball and Padel are the two fastest growing racquet sports and have captured the hearts of players worldwide including celebrities and sport stars such as Selena Gomez, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. While both sports may look similar at first glance, there are some notable differences in the equipment used, scoring rules and court size. Origins of the Game Pickleball first emerged in the US in 1965 at Bainbridge Island, Washington by Joel Pritchard. It is said that the sport was named after Joel’s dog Pickles but the sport is officially named after a Pickle Boat, which translates to a crew of leftovers in rowing. Pickleball made its way to Singapore in the 1990s and have up to 5,000 active players today across 30 interest groups. “Pickleball combines elements of ping pong, badminton & tennis.” Padel began in Mexico in 1969 by businessman Enrique Corcuera who was a vivid tennis fan and build the court in his home where the walls were installed to avoid vegetation from growing to the court. However, he realized the game became more enjoyable after allowing the balls to bounce from the wall. This improvisation led to the birth of padel. “Padel is a mixture of squash and tennis”. It is widely played in Europe and Latin America and recently expanded to Singapore in 2020, with over 2,000 active players today. Differences in the Rules Between Padel & Pickleball Pickleball Can be played as singles (one-on-one) or doubles (two players against two). Starts with an underhand serve made diagonally across the net. Before volleying, the ball must bounce once on each side. After two bounces, players can volley the ball or play it off a bounce. Features the “kitchen” - a non-volley zone where players cannot hit the ball unless it bounces first. Players rally until a fault occurs, such as hitting the ball out or failing to clear the net. Padel Exclusively played as doubles. Serves must be underhand, and the ball must bounce in the service box before a return. Players can use the court walls to play and return shots, similar to squash. The ball remains in play until it hits the net, goes out of bounds, or bounces twice on the court before being returned. Court Pickleball The court size is 20 ft wide by 44 ft long, with a non-volley zone called the “kitchen” extending 7 ft on either side of the net. The net height is 34 inches in the centre and 36 inches at the sidelines. Court is a hard surface of asphalt or concrete with a smooth finish. Court markings include a baseline, sidelines, non-volley zone, and service areas. The game can be played on converted tennis or badminton courts. Padel The court size is 33 ft wide and 66 ft long, enclosed by glass or mesh walls like a squash court. The net height stands at 34.6 inches. Larger than a pickleball court but smaller than a tennis court, typically made of artificial turf or concrete. Court markings include service boxes and baseline markings, similar to tennis. Equipment Pickleball Paddles are made of lightweight materials such as composite or graphite. They are solid, without strings, and resemble oversized table tennis paddles. The ball is a perforated plastic ball, similar to a wiffle ball. The net is placed lower than a tennis net, standing at 34 inches in the center. Padel Racquets are solid, perforated with holes, and made of composite materials. They are smaller and thicker than tennis racquets, heavier than pickleball paddles. They come without strings, offering better control and spin. Balls are similar to tennis balls but with less pressure, offering a controlled bounce. Scoring System Pickleball Uses a rally scoring system, where points are only scored by the serving team. Games are played to 11 points, and a team must win by at least 2 points. Matches are played in a best-of-three-games format Padel Follows traditional tennis scoring (from 15, 30, 40, to game point). Typically, matches are played to the best of three sets, with each set consisting of six games, and winning happens with a two-game margin. If a set reaches 6-6, a tiebreaker game decides the winner. Gameplay Style Pickleball relies on precision and strategy over power. The smaller court size, slower speed, and the \"kitchen\" rule is easy for beginners. One hour of play burns anywhere between 350-400 calories. Padel is faster-paced, combining power with finesse, and the use of walls. This, as part of the game, provides a challenge even for advanced players. Its faster pace gives an intensive calorie burn of up to 800 calories per hour. There is no better sport - it just depends on what you’re after! If you enjoy a tactical game, go for pickleball and if you prefer a dynamic, fast-paced one, it’s padel. Whichever you prefer, just pick up your paddle or racquet and head to the court and make new friends! Check out facilities and book a pickleball court now!

Yes, officers can build any number of forms to collect any number of submissions for free. I did not receive my OTP. Where is it? The OTP is sent immediately, but might take a while to arrive in your government email if there is high traffic on the government network. OTPs are sent almost immediately when requested. Hence most OTP delay issues tend to be on the recipients' agency's mail server end, due to possibility that emails have to go through several security layers in agencies' mail servers. If there is widespread OTP issues, we will inform admins via our communication channels. If you have already requested a second OTP, the first OTP will be invalid.\nIf you have not received your OTP after 10 minutes: Check if your login email is keyed in correctly and you are looking at the right inbox. Search for \"One-Time Password (OTP) for FormSG\". Check junk/spam boxes. Look at outlook rules/junk email filter as FormSG OTPs come from an internet source. Use other browsers and/or personal devices (e.g. mobile device). Check if colleagues are also experiencing this delay. For DefenceMail, please reach out to DMZSupport@dsta.gov.sg and inform them as well. The previous form owners have left / My email has changed. These are some steps that you can take: If the owner/editors of the form are still in your agency, ask for access. Obtain internal approval for your IT Department to temporarily reinstate the email address, so that the email can be used to obtain OTP required to login and transfer ownership of the form. If you still need urgent access, we will only accept the request once you have added your ITD/HR involved in off-boarding to confirm that they will include off-boarding processes in future. ❗ To prevent such incidents from occurring, we strongly recommend that all IT departments add form ownership transfer in off-boarding for staff leaving. Is Form accessible on the Intranet/Overseas? FormSG is accessible on WOG Intranet in addition to the Internet. If you still cannot access https://form.gov.sg on your Intranet, please contact us for help. As long as you have an Internet / WOG Intranet connection, you can access form.gov.sg from all around the world. Note that to log in to create forms, you will also need access to your government email to retrieve the OTP. Can non-government agencies or students create forms? No. Only government agencies and approved organisations by Ministries can create forms. Is Form really up 24/7? Yes, we have a measured uptime of 99.93% since we launched. You may also view if FormSG is down on https://status.form.gov.sg/ . With regards to maintenance, there is no planned maintenance window. Most features are constantly deployed without downtime. We will typically inform FormSG users in advance for any major upgrades that may affect your existing workflows. Because we do not charge for the service, we do not have an SLA. The exception is other integrations such as SingPass, who operate separately from FormSG. Some of these services have planned maintenance, and you can find out more by contacting them. Do I need Internet / Intranet access to use Form? After logging in, you will remain logged in for 24 hours. This means you need not have both Intranet and Internet devices at all times; you can log in to your Internet device before you leave your office, and for 24 hours be able to create forms from one Internet device. You cannot use FormSG offline. Is Internet Explorer supported? Support for internet explorer is no longer available for Forms. Please use alternatives like Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

Persevering through challenges, HDB has since established public housing in Singapore as a benchmark of excellence. Beginning Blueprint In 1960, there was a housing crisis in Singapore. Many people were living in unhygienic slums and crowded squatter settlements. Only 9% of Singaporeans lived in government flats, while others yearned for a place to call home. The Housing & Development Board was thus set up on 1 February 1960, tasked to solve Singapore’s housing crisis. HDB sprang into action, and in less than 3 years, it had built 21,000 flats; 2 years later, that number was 54,000. Within a brief span of 10 years, HDB built a sufficient number of flats for Singaporeans and resolved the housing crisis. Supporting Pillars For HDB to successfully meet the difficult goals set out, it needed a sound public housing strategy. This strategy was defined by 3 crucial fundamentals: The concept of a sole agency A sole agency in charge of public housing enabled more effective resource planning and allocation. This concept made it possible for us to secure the land, raw materials, and manpower for large-scale construction to optimise results and achieve economies of scale. A total approach to housing By adopting a total approach covering planning and design , land assembly, and construction, the housing task was carried out as a seamless whole – through allocation, management, and maintenance. Strong government support Support from the government in the form of political and financial commitment, complemented by legislation, helped put early public housing on the right track quickly, which made housing the nation that much smoother and fruitful a journey. Landmark Housing HDB is now home to more than 80% of Singapore’s population, across 24 towns and 3 estates . Having completed more than 1 million flats and housed an entire nation, we believe there is more that we can do to build new-generation housing and smart, sustainable towns. We will continue to serve to the best of our abilities to create the best possible living environment where communities can thrive.", "last_updated": "Last Updated 06 January 2025", "size_kb": 119.375}

[2] Prime flats include Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) flats sold before October 2024 sales exercise. Resale levy The resale levy is meant to reduce the housing subsidy of a second subsidised flat. It ensures a fairer allocation of housing subsidies among flat buyers. If you have bought a subsidised housing, you must pay a resale levy when you are listed as a core applicant or core occupier in a flat application to buy a second subsidised flat. A subsidised housing is: A flat bought from HDB A resale flat bought with CPF housing grant(s) A Design Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flat bought from a property developer with CPF housing grant An Executive Condominium (EC) unit bought from a property developer Other forms of housing subsidy, e.g. enjoyed benefits under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), privatisation of HUDC estate etc. If you do not intend to buy a second subsidised flat from HDB, i.e., you are buying a resale flat or private residential property, you need not pay the resale levy. Payment of resale levy The resale levy payable is determined at the point you book your second subsidised flat. It applies regardless of ownership type (joint-tenancy or tenancy-in-common) or shared interest in the flat. Payment must be made using cash and/ or your flat sale proceeds, and not a housing loan. When and how payment is made Flat Sale Timeline Resale Levy Payment First subsidised flat was disposed of after key collection to the second subsidised flat Resale levy deducted from the net proceeds upon the sale of the first subsidised flat Any shortfall must be paid in cash First subsidised flat was disposed of before key collection to the second subsidised flat Resale levy must be paid in cash upon key collection to the second subsidised flat Subsidised flat sold on or after 3 March 2006 If you have sold your first subsidised flat from 3 March 2006 onwards, you will pay a fixed amount resale levy as follows: First Subsidised Housing Type Resale Levy Amount Households Recipient of CPF Housing Grant (Singles) 2-room/ 2-room Flexi flat $15,000 $7,500 3-room flat $30,000 $15,000 4-room flat $40,000 $20,000 5-room flat $45,000 $22,500 3Gen flat $45,000 Not applicable Executive flat $50,000 $25,000 Executive Condominium $55,000 Not applicable Subsidised flat sold before 3 March 2006 If the first subsidised flat was sold before 3 March 2006, a percentage graded resale levy will apply (see table for more details).

It was first piloted at the Yuhua estate, where 38 blocks of flats have been transformed into a ‘Green Neighbourhood’. A series of Greenprint Outreaches (GO) were organised for the residents of Yuhua to learn more about HDB Greenprint and tips on how to lead an eco-friendly lifestyle. Exhibition The HDB Greenprint exhibition held on 6 Oct 2012 at Yuhua marked the start of our partnership with residents for HDB Greenprint. Residents learnt about the plans under HDB Greenprint, and shared their views actively during the exhibition. GO.Eco Learning Journeys Since its launch, we have organised learning journeys to HDB’s Centre of Building Research to educate Yuhua residents on sustainable technologies and green practices. Residents welcomed the smart technologies and green features that were going to be installed in their neighbourhood. GO.Visits Residents at Yuhua were visited by student volunteers who inspired residents to live the eco-way by sharing tips on gracious and responsible heartland living.
